"Everything works and can be turned in as is. A few things that I may suggest just in case is :
AddTwoNumbers - everything looks good. nothing that really needs to be changed.
WhoYouAre - I would possibly recommend using an int instead of string for the WakeUp time variable just so it has to be a number, but nonetheless string works as well. 
GreaterThanOrLessThan - Everything works fine. only thing is caution you to maybe use "greater than" instead of higher and "less than" instead of lower just because thats what they said in instruction but i dont know how strict they will be about it."
